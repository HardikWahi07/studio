/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TripMind application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (users, trips, expenses, itinerary items)
 * and allows public read access for shared data (local businesses, supporters, app stats). Bookings have specialized rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles. Owner-only access.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}: Trips planned by a user. Owner-only access.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Expenses for a trip. Owner-only access.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}/itinerary_items/{itineraryItemId}: Itinerary items for a trip. Owner-only access.
 * - /local_businesses/{localBusinessId}: Local business listings. Publicly readable.
 * - /app-stats/{statId}: Global application statistics. Publicly readable.
 * - /supporters/{supporterId}: Local supporter profiles. Publicly readable.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Confirmed bookings between users and supporters. Special rules apply.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to local businesses, app stats, and local supporter profiles.
 * - Ownership is strictly enforced for user-related data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules leverage path-based ownership to avoid costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Publicly readable data (local businesses, app stats, supporters) is stored in top-level collections
 * to allow for simple, performant read operations.
