/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TripMind application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (users, trips, expenses, itinerary items),
 * allowing users to manage their own information. Public data (local businesses, app stats, local supporters) is
 * readable by all users.  Bookings are accessible to the user and supporter involved.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles and associated data.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}: Trip planning data.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Expense tracking.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}/itinerary_items/{itineraryItemId}: Itinerary details.
 * - /local_businesses/{localBusinessId}: Publicly accessible business listings.
 * - /app-stats/{statId}: Publicly accessible application statistics.
 * - /supporters/{supporterId}: Publicly accessible local supporter profiles.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Bookings between users and supporters.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly owned and managed by the user.
 * - Public data is readable by all.
 * - Users can only access bookings that they created or are involved in.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Bookings include `userId` and `supporterId` to avoid needing to query other collections for authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}, while public data is stored in top-level collections.
