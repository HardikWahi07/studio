/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TripMind application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-related data (profiles, trips, expenses, itinerary items).
 * Global application statistics and local supporter profiles are publicly readable.
 * Bookings have custom read/list access based on user and supporter IDs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}: Trips, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Expenses, owned by the user and associated with a trip.
 * - /users/{userId}/trips/{tripId}/itinerary_items/{itineraryItemId}: Itinerary items, owned by the user and associated with a trip.
 * - /local_businesses/{localBusinessId}: Local business information, publicly readable.
 * - /app-stats/{statId}: Global application statistics, publicly readable.
 * - /supporters/{supporterId}: Local supporter profiles, publicly readable.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Bookings between users and local supporters, with specific read and list access rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private; only the authenticated user can access their own profile, trips, expenses and itinerary items.
 * - Public listing of user-owned collections (trips, expenses, itinerary items) is allowed only to the owner, via the path-based ownership model.
 * - Global application statistics and local supporter profiles are publicly readable.
 * - The `list` operation on `/bookings` collection requires filtering by the authenticated user's ID.
 * - The `get` operation on `/bookings/{bookingId}` collection is allowed for either the user or the supporter involved in the booking.
